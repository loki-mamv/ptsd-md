            <p class="page-subtitle">Common questions about diagnosis, treatment, recovery, and living with PTSD—answered with evidence-based information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">What is PTSD?</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) is a psychiatric condition that can develop after a person experiences or witnesses a traumatic event such as combat, sexual assault, accidents, natural disasters, or other life-threatening situations.</p>
                <p>It's characterized by four main symptom clusters: intrusive memories (flashbacks, nightmares), avoidance behaviors, negative changes in thoughts and mood, and changes in arousal and reactivity (hypervigilance, being easily startled). PTSD is diagnosed when symptoms persist for more than one month and cause significant distress or functional impairment.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">Who develops PTSD?</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Anyone who experiences or witnesses trauma can develop PTSD. About 6% of the U.S. population will have PTSD at some point in their lives. Risk is higher for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Combat veterans (11-20%)</li>
                    <li>Sexual assault survivors (up to 50% of women)</li>
                    <li>Those with previous trauma, especially childhood trauma</li>
                    <li>People who lack social support after the event</li>
                    <li>Those with pre-existing mental health conditions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, the majority of people who experience trauma do NOT develop PTSD. Resilience is common.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">How is PTSD different from normal stress after trauma?</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>It's completely normal to feel stressed, anxious, or have trouble sleeping after a traumatic event. Most people have some symptoms in the first few weeks—this is a normal stress response.</p>
                <p>PTSD is different because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Symptoms persist beyond one month</li>
                    <li>Symptoms don't improve on their own and may get worse</li>
                    <li>The trauma is "re-experienced" as if it's happening now (flashbacks)</li>
                    <li>There's significant avoidance that limits your life</li>
                    <li>Symptoms interfere with work, relationships, and daily functioning</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">How is PTSD diagnosed?</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>PTSD is diagnosed by a mental health professional (psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker) through a clinical interview and assessment. There's no blood test or brain scan for PTSD.</p>
                <p>Diagnosis is based on the DSM-5 criteria, which require exposure to trauma plus symptoms from four clusters: intrusion, avoidance, negative cognition/mood, and arousal/reactivity. Symptoms must last more than one month and cause significant distress or impairment.</p>
                <p>Common assessment tools include the PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist) and CAPS-5 (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale).</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">Can PTSD be cured?</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes, many people with PTSD experience significant recovery and no longer meet diagnostic criteria after completing evidence-based treatment. Studies show that 53-80% of people who complete trauma-focused therapy (like CPT, PE, or EMDR) no longer have PTSD afterward.</p>
                <p>While "cure" is a strong word in mental health, recovery is absolutely possible. Many people go on to live full, meaningful lives. Some may occasionally experience symptoms during stressful times, but can manage them effectively with skills learned in treatment.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">How long does PTSD treatment take?</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Evidence-based treatments typically show significant improvement within 8-16 sessions (2-4 months) of weekly therapy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CPT:</strong> Usually 12 sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>Prolonged Exposure:</strong> Usually 8-15 sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>EMDR:</strong> Usually 6-12 sessions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Treatment duration varies based on trauma complexity, co-occurring conditions, and individual response. Some people with complex trauma may need longer treatment. The good news is that improvement often begins within the first few weeks.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">What medications treat PTSD?</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Two medications are FDA-approved specifically for PTSD:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sertraline (Zoloft)</strong> — SSRI antidepressant</li>
                    <li><strong>Paroxetine (Paxil)</strong> — SSRI antidepressant</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other medications used off-label include venlafaxine (Effexor) and prazosin (for nightmares).</p>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Klonopin) are NOT recommended for PTSD and may actually worsen outcomes.</p>
                <p>Medication is often most effective when combined with trauma-focused therapy. Talk to your prescriber about what's right for you.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">What is EMDR and how does it work?</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is an evidence-based therapy for PTSD. During EMDR, you briefly focus on traumatic memories while experiencing bilateral stimulation (usually side-to-side eye movements, but sometimes taps or sounds).</p>
                <p>This appears to help your brain reprocess traumatic memories so they become less distressing. After EMDR, the memory remains but doesn't carry the same emotional charge.</p>
                <p>EMDR is recognized by the WHO, APA, and VA as an effective PTSD treatment. It typically takes 6-12 sessions and may be a good option for people who are uncomfortable with extensive talking about their trauma.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">Is PTSD the same as Complex PTSD?</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) is a related condition that can develop from prolonged, repeated trauma, especially during childhood (such as ongoing abuse or neglect).</p>
                <p>In addition to standard PTSD symptoms, C-PTSD includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulties with emotional regulation</li>
                    <li>Persistent feelings of emptiness, shame, or worthlessness</li>
                    <li>Problems with relationships and trust</li>
                    <li>Changes in self-perception</li>
                </ul>
                <p>C-PTSD is recognized in the ICD-11 but not yet in the DSM-5. Treatment may be similar but sometimes requires more time and focus on emotion regulation and relationship patterns.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">Can children have PTSD?</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes, children can develop PTSD. Symptoms may look different than in adults:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Younger children may re-enact trauma through play</li>
                    <li>Nightmares may not have recognizable trauma content</li>
                    <li>Children may lose skills they had developed (like toilet training)</li>
                    <li>They may become clingy or have separation anxiety</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Effective treatments for children include Trauma-Focused CBT (TF-CBT), which involves both the child and caregivers. Early treatment can prevent long-term effects.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">Where can I get help for PTSD?</h2>
