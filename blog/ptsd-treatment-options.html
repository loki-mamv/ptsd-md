        <h1>PTSD Treatment Options: What Works, According to the Evidence</h1>
        <div class="article-meta">Published February 11, 2026 · 11 min read</div>
    </div>

    <main>
        <p>If you or someone you care about has been diagnosed with PTSD, the first thing to know is this: effective treatments exist, they have been rigorously tested, and most people who complete them get significantly better. The second thing to know is that not all treatments are equally supported by evidence, and understanding the difference matters.</p>

        <p>This guide covers the major treatment approaches for PTSD, organized by the strength of their evidence base, so you can have informed conversations with your treatment providers.</p>

        <h2>First-Line Treatments: Trauma-Focused Psychotherapy</h2>

        <p>Every major clinical guideline—from the American Psychological Association to the VA/DoD to the World Health Organization—identifies trauma-focused psychotherapy as the preferred treatment for PTSD. "Trauma-focused" means the therapy directly addresses the traumatic memories and their impact, rather than only managing symptoms.</p>

        <p>Three trauma-focused therapies have the strongest evidence.</p>

        <h3>Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)</h3>
        <p>CPT was developed by Patricia Resick in the late 1980s and has been tested in more than 20 randomized controlled trials. It works by identifying and challenging the distorted beliefs that develop after trauma—thoughts like "It was my fault," "I can never be safe," or "I can't trust anyone."</p>
        <p>A typical course of CPT involves 12 sessions, each lasting about 50 minutes. Patients work through structured worksheets that help them examine their trauma-related beliefs and develop more balanced perspectives. Some versions include a written trauma narrative; others focus entirely on cognitive restructuring.</p>
        <p>Research outcomes are strong. A landmark study of female sexual assault survivors found that 53% no longer met PTSD criteria after CPT, and improvements were maintained at follow-up. Studies with combat veterans have shown similar results, with 30-50% losing their PTSD diagnosis and the majority showing clinically significant symptom reduction.</p>

        <h3>Prolonged Exposure (PE)</h3>
        <p>Developed by Edna Foa at the University of Pennsylvania, PE is grounded in the principle that avoidance maintains PTSD. The therapy involves two core components: imaginal exposure, where patients retell the trauma narrative repeatedly in a safe environment until the emotional charge diminishes; and in vivo exposure, where patients gradually confront real-world situations they have been avoiding.</p>
        <p>PE typically requires 8 to 15 sessions of 90 minutes each. It involves between-session homework, including listening to recordings of imaginal exposure sessions and practicing in vivo exposure exercises.</p>
        <p>PE has been studied in more randomized controlled trials than any other PTSD treatment. A meta-analysis published in <em>Clinical Psychology Review</em> found large effect sizes for symptom reduction across diverse trauma populations.</p>

        <h3>EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)</h3>
        <p>EMDR uses bilateral stimulation—most commonly guided eye movements—while the patient briefly focuses on traumatic memories. The therapy follows an eight-phase protocol and typically requires 6 to 12 sessions. Unlike PE, EMDR does not involve detailed verbal retelling of the trauma or between-session homework assignments.</p>
        <p>More than 30 randomized controlled trials support EMDR for PTSD. Head-to-head comparisons with CPT and PE generally show equivalent outcomes. Some patients prefer EMDR because it does not require extensive discussion of trauma details.</p>

        <h2>Medication Options</h2>

        <p>Medications are considered second-line treatment for PTSD, meaning they are recommended when therapy is unavailable, when the patient prefers medication, or as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Two medications have FDA approval specifically for PTSD.</p>

        <h3>Sertraline (Zoloft)</h3>
        <p>This selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) has been shown in multiple large trials to reduce PTSD symptoms across all four symptom clusters. Typical dosing is 50 to 200 mg daily. Response rates range from 50 to 60 percent, and the medication typically takes 4 to 6 weeks to reach full effect.</p>

        <h3>Paroxetine (Paxil)</h3>
        <p>Another SSRI with FDA approval for PTSD. It has shown efficacy in large controlled trials at doses of 20 to 60 mg daily. Side effects are similar to other SSRIs and include nausea, sexual dysfunction, and weight changes.</p>

        <h3>Venlafaxine (Effexor)</h3>
        <p>This serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) does not have FDA approval for PTSD but has strong evidence from randomized trials. The APA guidelines include it as a recommended medication option.</p>

        <h3>Prazosin for Nightmares</h3>
        <p>Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker originally used for high blood pressure. It has shown effectiveness in reducing PTSD-related nightmares and sleep disturbance in several studies, particularly among combat veterans. Results have been mixed in larger trials, but it remains widely used off-label when nightmares are a prominent symptom.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>Treatments to Avoid</h3>
            <p>Benzodiazepines (such as alprazolam, clonazepam, and diazepam) are not recommended for PTSD. Evidence suggests they do not improve PTSD symptoms, may interfere with trauma processing and extinction learning, increase the risk of developing PTSD when given after trauma exposure, and carry significant risks of dependence. The VA/DoD guidelines specifically recommend against their use in PTSD treatment.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Emerging and Adjunctive Treatments</h2>

        <h3>Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB)</h3>
        <p>This procedure involves injecting a local anesthetic into a cluster of nerves in the neck. Originally used for pain management, it has shown promise in reducing PTSD symptoms in preliminary studies and case series, particularly among military populations. The Department of Defense has funded research into SGB, but it is not yet established as a standard treatment. It is best considered an adjunctive option, not a replacement for trauma-focused therapy.</p>

        <h3>MDMA-Assisted Therapy</h3>
        <p>Clinical trials of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) combined with psychotherapy have shown striking results for treatment-resistant PTSD. Phase 3 trials published in <em>Nature Medicine</em> found that 71% of participants no longer met PTSD criteria after three MDMA-assisted therapy sessions. However, as of early 2026, MDMA-assisted therapy has not received FDA approval. The FDA rejected the initial application in 2024, citing concerns about trial methodology, and additional research is underway.</p>

        <h3>Ketamine and Esketamine</h3>
        <p>Ketamine, administered intravenously, has shown rapid but temporary reductions in PTSD symptoms in small studies. Esketamine (Spravato), a nasal spray approved for treatment-resistant depression, is being studied for PTSD. Evidence is preliminary, and neither is currently recommended as a standard PTSD treatment.</p>

        <h3>Yoga and Mindfulness</h3>
        <p>Trauma-sensitive yoga and mindfulness-based interventions have growing evidence as adjunctive treatments. A study by Bessel van der Kolk published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Psychiatry</em> found that a 10-week yoga program significantly reduced PTSD symptoms in women with chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD. These approaches are best used alongside, not instead of, evidence-based trauma therapy.</p>

        <h2>How to Choose a Treatment</h2>

        <p>The "best" treatment for PTSD is the evidence-based treatment that you will actually complete. Research consistently shows that the biggest predictor of treatment success is completion—finishing the full course of therapy. Here are factors to consider:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Preference for talking vs. not:</strong> If discussing trauma details at length feels overwhelming, EMDR or CPT (without the written narrative) may be better starting points than PE.</li>
            <li><strong>Homework tolerance:</strong> PE and CPT involve between-session assignments. EMDR generally does not. If homework compliance is a concern, that may influence the choice.</li>
            <li><strong>Availability:</strong> In some areas, trained PE or EMDR therapists are more available than CPT therapists, or vice versa. Telehealth has expanded access significantly.</li>
            <li><strong>Severity:</strong> For severe PTSD with co-occurring depression or suicidal ideation, combining therapy with medication may produce better results than either alone.</li>
            <li><strong>Complex trauma:</strong> People with extensive childhood trauma or complex PTSD may benefit from a longer stabilization phase before beginning trauma processing, though this remains an area of active research.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>The Most Important Step</h3>
            <p>Research shows that the single most impactful decision is starting treatment at all. Many people with PTSD wait years before seeking help—the average delay is over six years. Every evidence-based treatment option described above has a strong track record of helping people recover. The best time to begin is now.</p>
